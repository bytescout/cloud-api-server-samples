##### ****ConvertPdfToHtmlFromUrl.js:**
    
```
// Please NOTE: In this sample we're assuming Cloud Api Server is hosted at "https://localhost". 
// If it's not then please replace this with with your hosting url.

var https = require("https");
var path = require("path");
var fs = require("fs");

// Direct URL of source PDF file.
const SourceFileUrl = "https://bytescout-com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/demo-files/cloud-api/pdf-to-html/sample.pdf";
// Comma-separated list of page indices (or ranges) to process. Leave empty for all pages. Example: '0,2-5,7-'.
const Pages = "";
// PDF document password. Leave empty for unprotected documents.
const Password = "";
// Destination HTML file name
const DestinationFile = "./result.html";
// Set to `true` to get simplified HTML without CSS. Default is the rich HTML keeping the document design.
const PlainHtml = false;
// Set to `true` if your document has the column layout like a newspaper.
const ColumnLayout = false;

// Prepare request to `PDF To HTML` API endpoint
var queryPath = `/pdf/convert/to/html?name=${path.basename(DestinationFile)}&password=${Password}&pages=${Pages}` + 
    `&simple=${PlainHtml}&columns=${ColumnLayout}&url=${SourceFileUrl}`;
var reqOptions = {
    host: "localhost",

// Send request
https.get(reqOptions, (response) => {
