// If it's not then please replace this with with your hosting url.

var https = require("https");

var fs = require("fs");

// Direct URL of source PDF file.
const SourceFileUrl = "https://bytescout-com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/demo-files/cloud-api/pdf-to-xml/sample.pdf";

const Pages = "";
// PDF document password. Leave empty for unprotected documents.
const Password = "";
// Destination XML file name
const DestinationFile = "./result.xml";


// Prepare request to `PDF To XML` API endpoint
var queryPath = `/pdf/convert/to/xml?name=${path.basename(DestinationFile)}&password=${Password}&pages=${Pages}&url=${SourceFileUrl}`;
