var fs = require("fs");

// Direct URL of source PDF file.
const SourceFileUrl = "https://bytescout-com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/demo-files/cloud-api/pdf-to-image/sample.pdf";
// Comma-separated list of page indices (or ranges) to process. Leave empty for all pages. Example: '0,2-5,7-'.
const Pages = "";
// PDF document password. Leave empty for unprotected documents.
const Password = "";
// Destination TIFF file name
const DestinationFile = "./result.tif";


// Prepare request to `PDF To TIFF` API endpoint
var queryPath = `/pdf/convert/to/tiff?name=${path.basename(DestinationFile)}&password=${Password}&pages=${Pages}&url=${SourceFileUrl}`;
var reqOptions = {
    host: "localhost",
    path: encodeURI(queryPath)

// Send request
https.get(reqOptions, (response) => {

        var data = JSON.parse(d);        
        if (data.error == false) {
            // Download TIFF file
