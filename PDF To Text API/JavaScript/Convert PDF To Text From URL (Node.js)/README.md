##### ****ConvertPdfToTextFromUrl.js:**
    
```
// Please NOTE: In this sample we're assuming Cloud Api Server is hosted at "https://localhost". 
// If it's not then please replace this with with your hosting url.

var https = require("https");
var path = require("path");
var fs = require("fs");

// Direct URL of source PDF file.
const SourceFileUrl = "https://bytescout-com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/demo-files/cloud-api/pdf-to-text/sample.pdf";
// Comma-separated list of page indices (or ranges) to process. Leave empty for all pages. Example: '0,2-5,7-'.
const Pages = "";
// PDF document password. Leave empty for unprotected documents.
const Password = "";
// Destination TXT file name
const DestinationFile = "./result.txt";

// Prepare request to `PDF To Text` API endpoint
var queryPath = `/pdf/convert/to/text?name=${path.basename(DestinationFile)}&password=${Password}&pages=${Pages}&url=${SourceFileUrl}`;
var reqOptions = {
    host: "localhost",
    path: encodeURI(queryPath)
};
// Send request
https.get(reqOptions, (response) => {
    response.on("data", (d) => {
        // Parse JSON response
        var data = JSON.parse(d);        
        if (data.error == false) {
