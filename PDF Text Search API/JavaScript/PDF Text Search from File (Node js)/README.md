##### **app.js:**
    
```
// Please NOTE: In this sample we're assuming Cloud Api Server is hosted at "https://localhost". 
// If it's not then please replace this with with your hosting url.

var fs = require("fs");

// `request` module is required for file upload.
// Use "npm install request" command to install.
var request = require("request");

// Source file name
const SourceFile = "./sample.pdf";

// Comma-separated list of page indices (or ranges) to process. Leave empty for all pages. Example: '0,2-5,7-'.
const Pages = "";

// PDF document password. Leave empty for unprotected documents.
const Password = "";

// Search string. 
const SearchString = '[4-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9]'; // Regular expression to find numbers in format dd.dd and between 40.00 to 99.99

// Enable regular expressions (Regex) 
const RegexSearch = 'True';

// Prepare URL for PDF text search API call.
var query = `https://localhost/pdf/find`;
let reqOptions = {
    uri: query,
    formData: {
        password: Password,
        pages: Pages,
        searchString: SearchString,
        regexSearch: RegexSearch,
        file: fs.createReadStream(SourceFile)

// Send request
request.get(reqOptions, function (error, response, body) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error("Error: ", error);

    // Parse JSON response
    let data = JSON.parse(body);
